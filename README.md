# All About Dogs

## Selection Of Over 100+ Breeds
-   Selecting a breed will show you an image of the breed and a slew of informatin about the breed (Description, History, Life Span, Origin, Temperament, and Weight)

## Issues I've Came Across
-   Trying to import a `getDogImage` function. Successfully imported, but the function ended up giving my random dog images and not the correct image for the dog. Decided to directly use the image.url in my main scripts file. (Learned I had to put type =module in HTML to import)

## Reflection
-   What i could've done differenlt during the planning stage of my project to make excuetion easier was to psuedo code the entire program first so I could've spent more time on working on my import function

-   What I would like to add to my application if given more time is a complete Landing Page , so the page you see isn't the default landing page. I'd also like to add a nav bar and allow me to switch to a "ALL ABOUT CATS" section of the website
